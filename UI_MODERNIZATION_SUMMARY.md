- `cursor-pointer` for interactive elements
- Semantic color names (destructive vs red-600)
- Better keyboard navigation support

### 5. **Performance**
- Removed excessive backdrop-blur
- Cleaner transitions with transition-all
- Proper loading states

### 6. **Micro-interactions**

## Build Status

✅ **Build Compiles Successfully**
- All components compile without errors
- TypeScript compilation successful

⚠️ **Pre-existing Linting Issues**
The following errors exist in the codebase but were not introduced by these changes:
- `app/api/auth/login/route.ts` - Unused variables and `any` types
- `app/profile/[id]/page.tsx` - Unused imports and `any` types  
- `app/profile/page.tsx` - Unused imports
- `app/users/page.tsx` - Some `any` types and exhaustive deps warning
- `components/issues/issue-card.tsx` - Unused CardContent import, img element warning
- `components/modals/create-issue-modal.tsx` - Unused variables, img element warnings
- `lib/auth.ts` - Unused imports

These are intentional or part of unfinished features and should be addressed separately.

## Testing Recommendations

While I cannot run the development server in this environment, here are the recommended tests:

1. **Home Page**
   - Visit `/` and verify the landing page loads correctly
   - Check responsive behavior on mobile, tablet, and desktop
   - Verify Google sign-in button works

2. **Dashboard**
   - Sign in and navigate to `/users`
   - Check header is sticky and backdrop blur works
   - Verify issue cards display properly
   - Test search functionality
   - Check empty state when no issues found

3. **Create Issue Modal**
   - Click the FAB button
   - Upload an image (drag and drop)
   - Select a category
   - Fill description
   - Review and submit
   - Verify step indicator updates correctly

4. **Responsive Design**
   - Test all pages on mobile (320px width)
   - Test on tablet (768px width)
   - Test on desktop (1024px+ width)
   - Verify spacing and typography scale properly

5. **Accessibility**
   - Tab through all interactive elements
